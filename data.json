It reports that the FTC is \u201cseeking assurances from Apple that it will prevent sensitive health data collected by its upcoming smartwatch and other mobile devices from being used without owners\u2019 consent\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe report also claims that Apple is stressing during the conversations that it will not be selling health data to third parties like advertisers, with spokesperson Trudy Muller telling Reuters that \u201cwe designed HealthKit with privacy in mind\u201d.\r\n\r\nThis is less an Apple issue than it is a wider regulatory challenge, when health data is heavily protected if it\u2019s gathered in a medical context, but much more of a grey area when it\u2019s gathered by an app and\/or device.\r\n\r\nSo, questions: if you\u2019re using health-tracking apps and gadgets, are you thinking about the privacy of your data? Have you dug into the providers\u2019 privacy policies and found anything reassuring or worrying?\r\n\r\nAnd if you don\u2019t use these apps and devices, is privacy one of the reasons? What are your concerns, and how would you like to see technology firms and regulators alike approaching the issue?

Watch now for the ripples as other publishers react.\r\nSamsung is apparently spending \u201ctens of millions\u201d developing a new shortform video service codenamed Volt, which would try to take on YouTube with exclusive content and, possibly, music. Although YouTube has plenty of both, so it would be a tough challenge.\r\nThis is a really interesting use of Oculus Rift and virtual reality: Canadian environmental group Dogwood Initiative is using the technology to show what an oil tanker spill near Vancouver might look like, and how it would affect the city.\r\n\u201cThe men are coming to Pinterest\u201d reports TechCrunch. Apparently men now account for a third of all new signups to the site, whose gender split has traditionally been 70-30 or 80-20 in favour of women. And in countries like India, Japan and South Korea, the split is now 50-50.\r\nFinally, Tubefilter and OpenSlate have published their latest chart of the top 100 games channels on YouTube. It\u2019s another reminder of just how popular games are on the service, with 4.6bn views for the top 100 alone. No surprises for guessing who\u2019s top: PewDiePie.\r\nWhat else?

Germain","image":"8e2787221b937e8d2206fc24368815b348655962.jpeg","category":"AVeQybI27FG0uL66Doa2","content":"GE and Bosch Software Innovations this week announced a partnership to jump-start the development of an open source Internet of Things platform.\r\n\r\nOpen source will encourage greater interoperability and application development, the companies said. Both firms have sought help from the Eclipse Foundation to speed up the process.\r\n\r\nUnder the agreement, the companies will create a core IoT stack comprised of open source software. The stack will provide interoperability between GE's Predix operating system and the Bosch IoT Suite.\r\n\r\nGE Digital and Bosch Software Innovations will develop complementary software services for each other's cloud platforms to improve services for a wider customer base.\r\n\r\n\"This is a high-value initiative that should be of great interest to the Java, IoT and embedded developer community,\" said Azul Systems CEO Scott Sellers.\r\n\r\n\"The Eclipse Foundation has been at the forefront of helping to improve the IoT developer ecosystem for some time, and this is a continuation of that trend,\" he told LinuxInsider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExploratory Venture\r\n\r\nThe goal is more to test the waters than push for leadership in creating an open source IoT standard, said Matt Jennings, regional president of the Americas for Bosch's Software Innovations division.\r\n\r\n\"Creating an open source standard from this partnership will have to be determined,\" he told LinuxInsider.\" We have to study the progress of the industrial Internet and make a determination if we can come up with a common form that will make sense in those environments.\"\r\n\r\nThat exploratory attitude led to the partnership. The companies approached the common effort as two large industrial firms aspiring to support the IoT, Jennings said.\r\n\r\n\"It started to make sense, since we are both contributing to the Open Source Alliance, that we should start working together to eliminate redundancy,\" he explained. \"We could then do better work and work faster.\"\r\n\r\nThe Fine Print\r\n\r\nThe software development includes enhancing work on several existing open source projects under the Eclipse Foundation. The software involves creating code for messaging, user authentication, access control and device descriptions, according to GE.\r\n\r\nNot all of the software associated with the existing platforms at GE and Bosch may be open-sourced, however. Both companies probably will retain some parts of their existing software.\r\n\r\n\"We will have to determine where those areas of proprietary software are. I suspect that we will each retain certain properties,\" said Jennings.\r\n\r\nThe Eclipse Foundation may come into play more prominently on connectivity issues. The foundation's projects that focus on device connectivity include Eclipse Hono, Eclipse Vorto and Eclipse Leshan. Other Eclipse projects are GE-enhanced User Account and Authentication and Eclipse Access Control Service.\r\n\r\nThe GE and Bosch partnership is an interesting development, said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT.\r\n\r\nIf the Internet of Things is going to work as envisioned, it needs to be based on open technologies supporting collaborations like the one announced by GE and Bosch, he suggested.\r\n\r\n\"In essence, the companies have agreed to pool their software resources to enable the integration of their own platforms and devices,\" King told LinuxInsider, and they \"will leverage Eclipse Foundation technologies to keep things on the up and up. In contrast, IoT solutions based on proprietary technologies or a single vendor's platforms are virtually guaranteed to be limiting and prone to locking in customers.\"\r\n\r\nA Desperate Need\r\n\r\nThe need surrounding this IoT initiative is clear, noted Azul Systems' Sellers. It responds to a need for more high-quality tools and developer platforms backed by innovation.\r\n\r\nThat only helps \"accelerate the development of new devices and new gateways throughout the IoT,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBoth GE and Bosch have developed Cloud Foundry and microservices-centric platforms, so the level of interoperability should be very strong, Sellers added.\r\n\r\nSuccess Not Guaranteed\r\n\r\nCompanies like GE, Bosch and others have a great deal to win or lose based on how they deliver IoT to the market, according to Don DeLoach, CEO of Infobright.\r\n\r\nThat enables them to deploy IoT solutions that can facilitate leveraging the underlying utility value of their IoT data to maximize leverage and insight, he pointed out.\r\n\r\n\"While the idea of controlling relationships by locking in customers with proprietary platforms may have short-term appeal, the major players in IoT who see the long view of the market recognize the imperative for organizations using IoT solutions to interoperate,\" DeLoach told LinuxInsider.\r\n\r\n\"I applaud the initiative and direction of GE and Bosch shown by this initiative,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe partnership gives GE and Bosch reach across global markets and industries. The resulting efforts should be both powerful and flexible, noted Pund-IT's King.\r\n\r\n\"That should be particularly welcome among manufacturers and companies that wish to adopt an IoT platform and strategy that extends across all of their markets and areas of interest. The fact that GE and Bosch's platform is not dependent on any specific IT platform will also appeal to companies that hope to avoid being locked into relationships with specific vendors,\" he said.\r\n\r\nLimiting Factors\r\n\r\nAs with all open source initiatives, the balance is between free downloads and an ability to secure long-term support as needed, either from the Eclipse -- and Bosch\/GE -- developer community or direct from the vendors themselves, Sellers said.\r\n\r\nThe project is in very early days. Any number of barriers may spring up during the development process, noted King.\r\n\r\n\"It will also be interesting to see which, if any, vendors actively support or resist the collaboration,\" he said. \"The more the merrier, as they say, but some may consider what GE and Bosch propose as a threat to their own IoT hope and ambitions.\"","created_at":"2016-10-04T19:51:33+0000","updated_at":"2016-10-04T19:51:33+0000","comments":[],"url":"\/article\/ge_bosch_combine_resources_to_bolster_iot\/"}},

For acts like Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington and Limp Bizkit\u2019s Fred Durst -- both of whom appeared in an all-star jam spearheaded by the Cult's Billy Morrison -- supporting sobriety was a big reason to come out. The other was to be on hand to pay tribute to the night\u2019s guest of honor, Social Distortion leader Mike Ness.\r\n\r\n\u201cDude, Social Distortion played such a huge part in my musical life, huge, huge, huge,\u201d a visibly excited Bennington told Billboard backstage. \u201c\u2019Mommy\u2019s Little Monster\u2019 was probably one of the most pivotal songs in my early life \u2018cause I loved that track so much. It turned me on to Social Distortion, turned me on to Misfits, so much great punk music.\u201d\r\n\r\nDurst, who rocked Rage Against The Machine\u2019s \u201cKilling In The Name Of\u201d while Bennington stood side stage and pumped his fist and sang along to every word, told Billboard he couldn\u2019t perform a Social D song out of respect for the greatness of the songs. \r\n\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do any of them, too big of a fan,\u201d Durst said. \u201cHe writes incredibly universal themes in his songs and melodies, but he\u2019s putting this incredible background he owns for himself. These songs are really good.\u201d \r\n\r\nAs the man of the moment, Ness was flattered, but a little overwhelmed by the attention and surprised at being honored for sobriety that began 31 years ago this month. \u201cI would\u2019ve never expected this at all, having this much time clean and sober or having a rock and roll event that celebrates this because when I got clean it wasn\u2019t cool to be clean,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ness recalls he had no choice. \u201cI got sober October, 1985 and sex, drugs and rock and roll had turned to sex and drugs, then just drugs,\u201d he recalled. \u201cPeople were walking out of shows, all the band\u2019s gear was in the pawn shop. I was either in jail or missing and the band was falling apart. When I got clean I didn\u2019t really know if I was going to be able to do it.\u201d\r\n\r\nOver the years, Ness, one of punk\u2019s great poets, has put those tales into his music again and again, something Bennington admires greatly. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the greatest songwriters of our time. He took punk music and made it acceptable, and not just punk music, but really tough s--t,\u201d Bennington said. \u201cMike didn\u2019t talk about things that were easy. He talked about going to prison, his abuse, he talked about his life and the troubles.\u201d\r\n\r\nEspecially at Rock To Recovery, an organization founded by Wesley Geer (Hed P.E. and Korn), who hopes to turn the success of the inaugural event into a yearly tradition and potentially a branded tour down the road. Those troubles were on the forefront of people\u2019s minds, particularly Bennington, who is passionate about helping those with substance abuse problems.\r\n\r\n\u201cI really advocate for guys who are struggling in the prison system. I think that our prison system is chock full of people who have substance abuse problems and can actually be helped much more by actual rehab,\u201d said Bennington. \u201cPersonally I\u2019d rather use my tax money to send people to rehab than prison because they sit there and do nothing. I believe that prison hurts people and fortunately some of us get to live through those stories.

What a wonderful night, huh?  It was magical. That\u2019s the only way I can describe it. It is definitely one that I will not forget any time soon. Four lads being from Mississauga and playing SkyDome [its former name] is obviously a dream come true, literally a dream come true.\r\n\r\nHow do you prepare to play a venue that\u2019s so huge and reach those people in the 500 level?\r\nWe\u2019ve had the fortune of playing big festivals across Europe with 80-to-110,000 people. So we have played in front of big crowds. It\u2019s a different when it\u2019s a dome because they\u2019re everywhere, as high as you look and as close as you can get, right in front of the stage. We just got up there and did our thing. We turn it up loud and have fun.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ve obviously attended shows and baseball games there.\r\nI go to [Toronto Blue] Jays games as regularly as I can. I\u2019m a huge Jays fan. One of the great things about the evening was our dressing room was in the away team\u2019s dugout behind us, so we got to sit in the dugout and drink beer and watch GNR play. I was just giddy.\r\n\r\nDid you get to meet them?\r\nNo. We had a chance to hang out with Duff [McKagan] quite a few times. We did some touring with his band in Australia as part of this festival and we did our own show in Sydney and he was like, \"Can I come to your show?\" \"Yes, you can.\" He came to the show and we hung out with him. He\u2019s an absolute gentleman and such a lovely, lovely dude. He seems to really enjoy the band. A little daunting when you\u2019re singing and you\u2019re looking at the front of house board and there\u2019s Duff standing there. I am assuming somewhere down the line, that\u2019s how we maybe got the call. I haven\u2019t spoken to him about it. But I think he might have influenced the powers that be to get us put us on the bill. I was just sitting in my hotel room one day and I got the email that said they wanted us to play and there was a lot of fist-pumping and high-fiving going on.\r\n\r\nA lot has happened in the world since you released your last album  [2012\u2019s Dead Silence] -- gay marriage was legalized in the States; Trump is a presidential nominee; the rise of ISIS; death of Bowie, Prince and Lemmy.  That\u2019s a lot of fodder for someone like you. \r\nNot just for me. For everyone.  It\u2019s been a very turbulent, trying, sad, tragic year, and needless to say, every time you turn on your computer or flip on the TV, there\u2019s some awful thing happening somewhere. This record, Ian, more so than before, is the main songwriter in the band and he definitely took a lot of the charge for the lyrics. He produced the record as well. So this is definitely his brainchild and I\u2019m also very proud of him, I should also note. \r\n\r\nWhen we started working on putting the lyrics together, he already had a lot of ideas sketched out.  It\u2019s definitely has a lot of tough topics we address on the record, but the one thing we feel that we\u2019ve accomplished on the record, we discuss a lot of these horrible, awful things that happen, but at the end of the day I think the record represents that there\u2019s still hope, and that we\u2019re like-minded people and together in this, and with love and compassion and tolerance and empathy and the beliefs in the greater good that we\u2019re going to get through all this stuff and come out the other side as better versions of people we were before.  \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s really hard because I feel right now that everyone\u2019s scared. There\u2019s just fear. There\u2019s this rampant fear that is running through every culture and geographically, no matter where we\u2019re at, and having spent time in Europe and talking to these people, there\u2019s this fear. And throughout history, when fear is your main modus operandi, that\u2019s when things go really wrong really quickly. But on the flip side of that, I also think things can improve just as quickly. We\u2019re all just passengers riding on this planet together. We just try to have fun and we believe that music is a very cathartic thing and so we hope enjoy the tunes. I think it\u2019s the best sounding and the best songs that we\u2019ve written in a really long time so we hope people dig it.\r\n\r\nObviously, you are life-long friends and probably he main reason is you all views these issues similarly, which is important if you have to sing songs and Ian is writing the bulk of them. \r\nIt\u2019s true. We\u2019re all morally aligned. We hold the same values. We believe in the same things. So when there are songs with some heavy subject matter, it\u2019s not just me and Ian; we talk about it with the band. It\u2019s very transparent.\r\n\r\nAaron has to sit out of the band right now because of his MS and that news delayed the recording a bit.\r\nThere were some time things that were affected, obviously due to Aaron\u2019s situation. That was the reason we pushed the recording back, and then we started in January. I don\u2019t know if that was the best idea or one that we\u2019ll do again. It\u2019s a hard month to start recording. You have the new year and the weather is shit and we were going in to the studio without Aaron so it was strange. There were just a lot of oddities and it ended up smoothing itself out over time, but it was a hard month. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll do that again. But the best thing about this record and the many great things is that we got to record the whole thing in Toronto for the first time. That was really special to be able to go home and sleep in our own beds and go to our studio where there were no time constraints. We could work as much or as hard or as little as we wanted.\r\n\r\nHow is Aaron? Did he see you play with Guns? \r\nYes he was there.  He has a team of people who are working with him whose goal is to get him back on the drums; he\u2019s feeling inspired and optimistic again and he believes that he can do this and we believe that he can do this as well.","created_at":"2016-10-04T19:30:20+0000","updated_at":"2016-10-04T19:30:20+0000","comments":[],"url":"\/article\/billy_talent_frontman_talks_giddy_guns_n_roses_opening_slot_gives_update_on_drummers_ms_battle\/"}},

But how are you feeling about Uber and other companies of its type, in regards to privacy?\r\n\r\nDo you worry about the way your data fits into the \u201csharing economy\u201d, or do the benefits of services like Uber and Airbnb trump any concerns that your records will be used against you in the future?

The couple ended their relationship when their children were one and five years old, respectively. The court held that because Partanen was intimately involved in raising the children, she should have the same rights as any person would as a member of a heterosexual relationship.\r\n\r\nThe rights of same-sex couples, and same-sex parents in particular, have been particularly contentious of late.

The trucks involved in this new investigation have that same engine.\r\nIn the May recall, the problem was due to an internal brake fluid leak which caused a loss of brake pressure. When that happened, drivers would be alerted by warning chimes, messages and warning lights. There could also be a loss of front brake function and, consequently, longer stopping distances.\r\nRelated - Ford fact-checks Trump: We will be here forever\r\nNow, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, some drivers of 2015 trucks have complained of similar issues, with greatly reduced brake function along with warning lights and tones. Some drivers of 2016 trucks have also complained of brake problems but without any warning lights or tones.\r\nNHTSA investigators are looking into the problem to see if the recall Ford announced in May should be expanded to include the 2015 and 2016 model years trucks.

Until the investigation is completed, though, it's still not clear if any of those will be added to the recall.\r\nFord (F) will cooperate with NHTSA the investigation, spokesman Mike Levine said.\r\n\"We continuously evaluate our processes for potential improvements, and when the data indicates a safety recall is needed, we move quickly on behalf of our customers,\" he said.","created_at":"2016-10-06T06:57:33+0000","comments":[],"url":"\/article\/ford_f150_brakes_under_investigation_by_regulators\/"}},

With stellar lens designs such as the 35mm f\/1.4 Art and 50mm f\/1.4 Art lenses, we have been waiting for Sigma to release an 85mm f\/1.4 Art lens for quite sometime now, so Sigma has finally delivered. The new 85mm f\/1.4 Art promises to be a superb lens both in terms of sharpness and bokeh. Although Sigma is yet to provide MTF charts and lens construction images, the fact that there is no aspherical element in the lens design is an indication of the lens being optimized to yield pleasant-looking bokeh without onion rings, something that has plagued other Art-series Sigma lens designs. Its price is a bit steep at $1,199 MSRP, but it is still $400 cheaper than its Nikon counterpart.\r\nThe 12-24mm f\/4 Art looks pretty solid as well, considering that it is designed for full-frame cameras. It rivals primarily with Canon\u2019s 11-24mm f\/4L lens rather than Nikon\u2019s 14-24mm f\/2.8, since those extra 2mm of focal length differences are huge. And price-wise, it is not a cheap lens either \u2013 at $1,599 MSRP, it is pretty darn close to Nikon\u2019s 14-24mm, although if you were to compare it to Canon\u2019s $3K 11-24mm f\/4L, is is still quite a bargain. With a number of aspherical and low dispersion glass elements, this should be a stellar wide-angle lens though. As expected from such a lens design, the front element of the lens is huge, making it impossible to mount filters. You would need to get something like the WonderPana with those huge and expensive filters in order to be able to mount them.\r\nLastly, another surprise is the Sigma 500mm f\/4 Sport DG OS HSM lens, a flagship super telephoto lens designed specifically for sports and wildlife photographers. This one looks quite attractive as well, but with lack of key specifications like its weight, it is impossible to say how it will be able to compete with both Nikon\u2019s and Canon\u2019s flagship 500mm f\/4 lenses, both of which have fluorite elements and other optimizations to keep their weights very low. However, its street price of $5,999 definitely makes it look attractive compared to the big name brands, who sell their 500mm f\/4 lenses at much steeper prices.","created_at":"2016-10-06T07:08:32+0000","comments":[],"url":"\/article\/sigma_85mm_f14_art_1224mm_f4_art_and_500mm_f4_sport_announcement\/"}}
